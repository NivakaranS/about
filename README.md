# About

I'm a Full Stack Developer, Data Scientist, and AI Engineer, currently pursuing a B.Sc in Information Technology with a specialization in Data Science at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). I am passionate about building intelligent systems, solving real-world problems with data, and developing scalable applications. My expertise spans full-stack development (MERN, Next.js, React Native, Node.js), AI and machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLP, Computer Vision), data science (Python, Pandas, SQL, data analytics), and cloud technologies (AWS, Docker, Firebase).

"Stay hungry, stay foolish." – These words by Steve Jobs define my approach to both life and career. I believe in staying curious, continuously learning, and embracing challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone. I’m always eager to collaborate with professionals and organizations, exchange knowledge, and contribute to innovative projects that make an impact.
